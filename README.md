# Autonomous Crowd Safety Agent

This project uses Gemini and Firebase to monitor and manage safety at large public events.

**Introduction**

Our project is AI-driven system designed to improve safety at large public events by analyzing real time CCTV feeds. Using Google Gemini API, it detects crowd density from images/video snapshots, generates intelligent safety recommendations (like “Evacuate Zone A”), and pushes alerts to a live Firebase-powered dashboard. The system includes mobile-responsive UI, Firestore integration and automated alert generation for proactive crowd management.

**Problem Addressed**

Each year, overcrowding at concerts, religious events and rallies leads to stampedes, injuries, and fatalities.
Lack of real-time crowd intelligence → delayed responses, chaos.
Existing systems are manual, siloed, and reactive.
A smarter, proactive approach is urgently needed.

**Proposed Solution : Autonomous Crowd Safety Agent Powered by Agentic AI**

Multimodal AI agent that monitors CCTV, audio, IoT, and social media feeds in real-time.
Detects anomalies: stampedes, aggression, panic sounds, overcrowding.
Instantly alerts authorities and suggests dynamic evacuation routes.
Provides live updates to attendees via WhatsApp chatbot and dashboard.
